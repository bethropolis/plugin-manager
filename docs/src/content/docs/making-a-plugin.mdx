# Making a plugin

the plugins created using the plugin system are hook and event based.


> you can make a single file plugin or a multi-file plugin.

## single file plugin


in a single file plugin the format is simple.

##### rules:
- a plugin must have a class name that is equal to the file name eg `ExamplePlugin.php`
- the class must extend `\Bethropolis\PluginSystem\Plugin`
- the class must have a public function `initialize()`

<br/>

```php
class ExamplePlugin extends \Bethropolis\PluginSystem\Plugin
{

    public function initialize()
    {
        $this->linkHook('my_hook', array($this, 'myCallback'));
    }

    public function myCallback($name = [])
    {
        $name = array_shift($name);
        return "hello {$name}";
    }
}
```
<br/>

In the above example the class `ExamplePlugin` extends the `\Bethropolis\PluginSystem\Plugin` class.
The class has a function `initialize()` which will be called when plugins are loaded.
The `linkHook('my_hook', array($this, 'myCallback'))` function is used to link a plugin function to a hook.
